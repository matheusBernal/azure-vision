# Azure Vision Studio - Image Captioning
This project explores the Add Captions to Images feature of Azure Vision Studio, which uses AI to automatically generate descriptive captions for uploaded images.

Project Description
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability of Azure Vision Studio to analyze images of animals (foxes, dogs, and cats) and generate relevant captions. This repository contains:

Input images used for testing.
Captions generated by the Azure Vision Studio.
Key insights and potential applications of this technology.
Repository Structure
inputs/: Contains the original images of animals used for testing.
outputs/: Includes the captions generated by Azure Vision Studio for each image.
README.md: Project documentation with process details and results.
Process
Upload Images: The input images (foxes, dogs, and cats) were uploaded to Azure Vision Studio.

Image Captioning:

Tool Used: Add Captions to Images
Steps:
